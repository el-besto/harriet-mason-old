</p>

## KEY LINKS
[github repo](https://github.com/el-besto/harriet-mason)
[heroku]()



## KEY Deliverables
    - "A plan for your pages"  - see scope
    - "A well-defined and written out feature list" 
    - "A written Minimum Viable Product (MVP)"
    - "A list project milestones"



# MVP
    Design a site for my gma's 85 birthday celebration where invitees can access important links to attend the event (EVENT) and a way for them to share their favorite memories with her (GUESTBOOK). Only registered users should be able to post to the Guestbook for two reasons:
    1. We need to keep the messages secure, as they may contain private information, and
    2. We do not want random people on the web 'trolling' the site

    It would be nice to be able to upload photos, and comment on them, but its not a requirement
    It would be nice to register for Eventbrite directly through a front-end form in the app, but its not a requirement.



# SCOPE
